I study avian migrants in the context of ongoing global change processes, using combination of satellite tracking, field observation, and quantitative analyses techniques, to better understand the mechanisms underlying their population changes.



During my PhD, I studied the effects of weather and climate change on long-distance avian migrants. Specifically, I explored how birds select their flight altitude and migration routes in relation to various condition both in the atmosphere and on the ground. I also examined what factors contribute to the population decline of migratory bird. 



My research at Cornell Lab of Ornithology is focused on quantifying the macro-demography of North American birds using the Big Data sources such as eBird citizen science data, radar observation, and other climatic models. The goal of this project is to elucidate how extreme climatic events could explain demographic variation throughout the annual cycle of bird populations.
